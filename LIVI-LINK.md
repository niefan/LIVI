# LIVI Link

A CarPlay dongle, reflashed into a network accessory for LIVI's native CarPlay stack. It is
supported on Linux and macOS, and can provide:

- **MFi authentication** over the network
- **A Wi-Fi access point**
- **Bluetooth** as a vhci on Linux and on macOS the dongle pairs the phone

Each one is enabled separately in the settings. While the dongle is not selected in the settings,
LIVI turns its access point temporarily off to keep interference low.

## Supported hardware

Several bridges are the same board sold under different names, and one name can cover completely
different hardware. Vendors are known for keeping a product name while the board inside changes,
sometimes from one month to the next. The Mini Ultra3 alone has come with at least three different
boards so far, among them one with an Ingenic SoC and one with the Allwinner V821B. So the name on the box says little about what is inside. A
row counts as **confirmed** only once someone has successfully installed LIVI Link on that product.

| Firmware | Hardware | Sold as | Wi-Fi | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `imx6ul_iw416` | NXP i.MX6UL, IW416 | CPC200-CCPA | 5 GHz, 40 MHz | confirmed |
| `imx6ul_iw416` | NXP i.MX6UL, IW416 | CPC200-C2Air | 5 GHz, 40 MHz | not confirmed |
| `imx6ul_iw416` | NXP i.MX6UL, IW416 | CPC200-2Air | 5 GHz, 40 MHz | not confirmed |
| `v821b_aic8800d80` | Allwinner V821B, AIC8800D80 | Mini Ultra3 | 5 GHz, 80 MHz | confirmed |
| none | Ingenic | Mini Ultra3 | | not supported |
| `v821b_aic8800d80` | Allwinner V821B, AIC8800D80 | CPC200-C2Air | 5 GHz, 80 MHz | not confirmed |
| `ax520_aic8800d80` | Axera AX520CE, AIC8800D80 | CPC200-C2Air | 5 GHz, 80 MHz | confirmed[^mfi] |

[^mfi]: MFi authentication needs an MFi chip on the dongle. Without one, LIVI Link provides the
    access point and Bluetooth only.

That is why the provisioning tool probes the dongle before it writes anything, and reports hardware
it does not know as not found.

Two reports say the install fails on a CPC200-CCPA running stock firmware `2025.10.15.1127`,
where the dongle drops off USB before anything is written, but works after a downgrade to
`2025.02.25.1521` ([#341](https://github.com/f-io/LIVI/issues/341),
[#347](https://github.com/f-io/LIVI/issues/347)). We could not reproduce it here. A dongle on the
latest stock firmware installed fine. If yours drops off USB during the install, a downgrade and try again.

## Setup

Flashing a dongle is at your own risk. If it goes wrong, open an [issue](https://github.com/f-io/LIVI/issues). Most dongles can be recovered even after a failed flash.

Download `livi-link-provision` for your platform from the release page, then with the dongle
plugged in (with some dongles you also need to be on their Wi-Fi):

```bash
chmod +x livi-link-provision
./livi-link-provision
```

macOS quarantines downloads, so run this first:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine livi-link-provision
```

If the dongle is still on stock firmware, the tool asks you to unplug and replug it once. After
that it runs on its own: it backs up the flash, installs LIVI Link and waits until the dongle
answers as LIVI Link. A CPC200-CCPA restarts a few times on the way, because its kernel goes in
first. The backup is taken before anything is written and goes to
`~/Library/Application Support/LIVI/backup/dongle-backup/` on macOS, or
`~/.local/share/LIVI/dongle-backup/` on Linux.

A CPC200-CCPA that got LIVI Link from an earlier release runs it on top of the vendor firmware.
Its web interface cannot flash the current firmware, please use provisioning tool.

## Web interface

<http://livi-link.local/>, or <http://10.10.10.1/> over USB. It shows which firmware the dongle
runs, what the radio is actually doing (channel, width, clients, link rate), Bluetooth, and, if
the LED supports colours, its colour and brightness.

## Updating

Under **Firmware**, **Check** looks for a newer version and **Update** installs it. With
**Nightly** on it checks the nightly builds instead of the latest release. The device you have the
web interface open on needs internet access. Do not unplug the dongle while it writes. On a dongle
whose LED shows the states below, red and blue alternate until it is done. A CPC200-CCPA restarts
twice when an update brings a new kernel.

Every release has the firmware files attached, so you can also upload one by hand. The
provisioning tool updates a dongle the same way.

## LED

If the dongle has an LED, Wi-Fi uses the status LED[^led] and Bluetooth is blue.

| State | LED |
| --- | --- |
| Waiting for a Wi-Fi client | status LED blinks |
| Wi-Fi client connected | status LED on |
| Bluetooth paging | blue blinks |
| Bluetooth connected | blue on |
| Writing firmware | red and blue alternate |

[^led]: Red, or cyan if the LED supports colours. You can change colour and brightness on the
    web interface.

## Getting back to stock

With the `v821b_aic8800d80` or `ax520_aic8800d80` firmware, upload the backup the install made
(`v821b_stock_<date>.lfwb` or `ax520_stock_<date>.lfwb` in the backup folder) on the web interface
under **Firmware**. The dongle writes it and reboots into its original firmware. Do not unplug it
while it writes.

## If something goes wrong

If the dongle does not come up on USB or Wi-Fi, give it 30 seconds, then replug it. The logs are under `/tmp` on the dongle.

A CPC200-CCPA whose system does not come up stays in a rescue system after the next restart. It is
reachable over USB at `10.10.10.1`, and the provisioning tool installs LIVI Link again from there.

## Firmware

The firmware carries LIVI's version and the commit it was built from, for example
`9.0.0 (7850de95)`. The web interface shows both under **Firmware**.
